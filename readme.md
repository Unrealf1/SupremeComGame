This is going to be a game made in Godot engine. The game will be deployed as a web page. This means that renderer must be "compatibility" and no multithreading can be present. Game will be created in only few hours as a test for how well can this work with the help of AI.

Game is being made for a contest and it must be somehow related to "Supreme Commander". Contest jury is a russian Supreme Commander streamer "Lenkin"

Idea: My idea is to create a game where player controls a missile that must avoid anti-air defences of an enemy and fly as far as possible. This is a reference to "tactical missiles" in supreme commander that must be manually fired and deal lots of damage. Game will be 2.5D, meaning 3d graphics on one plane.

Gameplay: This is going to be an autoscroller. Side view, where the top of the screen is "up" and right is "forward".
  * Missile has hitpoints, they decrease when hit buy AA or obstacles. 0 hitpoints = death. First iteration: there's no option to restore hitpoints.
  * Missile has fuel, when fuel is burned, the run is over. Fuel is fairly easy to replenish, allowing for theoretically infinite runs. Planned, but not first iteration: temporary boost to speed while burning significantly more fuel.
  * Missile will be controlled with WASD allowing it to go around the screen, while screen itself always moves to the right. SPACE for boost and control for slow down might be added later.

Enemies:
  * Anti Air turrets. Just like in the original, there're few types of AA. At the minimum: machine gun based AA of humans, attraction based AA of AEON. Later lasers for cybrans and lightning for the seraphim.
  * Neutral obstacles (need to figure out what exactly goes here)
  * Planes that fly and shoot

Game should be easy to pickup and be very interesting in the first 3-10 minutes, as it's possible that this is all the time that jury will have with the game.
